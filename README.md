AtliQ Grands, a prominent player in India's hospitality sector with a 20-year legacy, faces challenges in maintaining its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment.
Increased competition and ineffective managerial decisions have led to this decline. To counteract this trend, the managing director seeks to leverage "Business and Data Intelligence" as a strategic solution. However, lacking an in-house data analytics team, the company plans to engage a third-party service provider to extract valuable insights from their historical data to inform their revenue management strategies.
